Well, thanks for taking the time to look over my exam. It was quite a fun challenge. This is a quick note to let you guys know I appreciate you taking the time to look over my work, and that I'd love for my coding skills to be able to make a difference at Ebay.

Technically, in regards to what you're looking for, I'm passionate about open source CMS systems, and have created components for use on Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress and Magento. The Drupal and Joomla ones are searchable on Joomla.org and Drupal.org under Golden Contact.
<br />

Thanks, David
